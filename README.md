# Scriptorium

*A collection of fragments, formulas, and functions.*

**Scriptorium** is a curated collection of small but purposeful code snippets, written across multiple programming languages, focused on scientific computing, numerical methods, and mathematical problem-solving. Each file is a quiet corner of thought—structured, tested, and documented (at least when the author’s not too lazy).

Currently includes scripts in:
- [Julia](https://julialang.org/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/)

This repository grows over time—each addition a new leaf in a quiet manuscript of code.

More languages and tools will be added as the work expands.

## ✦ Philosophy

Every file here is a fragment—written to capture a method, test a theory, or simply document an insight.  
This is not a framework. Not a package. It’s a living notebook.  
*Less like a library.*
