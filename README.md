# Scriptorium

*A collection of concise, purposeful code fragments â€” written, tested, and archived with care.*

## ðŸ“– About

**Scriptorium** is a curated repository of small code snippets and scripts â€” ranging from numerical methods in Python to linear algebra solvers in GNU Octave. Each piece is designed to be standalone, minimal, and focused on a specific task or method.

This is not a playground of throwaway code. It is a personal archive â€” like the scriptoriums of old, preserving knowledge, one function at a time.

## ðŸ§  Topics Covered

- Numerical methods (e.g. Bisection, Newton-Raphson, Euler)
- Linear algebra tools (e.g. LU decomposition, Gauss-Seidel)
- Basic data analysis / plotting
- Matrix operations in Octave & Python, and more.
- Miscellaneous math-related experiments
