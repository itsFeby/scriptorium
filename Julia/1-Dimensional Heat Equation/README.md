# 1D Heat Equation Simulation

A numerical solution to the partial differential equation (PDE) describing heat diffusion in a 1D medium using Julia.

## ðŸ“Œ Description

### Theoretical Background
The 1D Heat Equation is a partial differential equation (PDE) that describes how heat (or temperature distribution) propagates through a one-dimensional medium (e.g., a thin rod) over time. This equation serves as a fundamental example of diffusion equations with wide applications in physics, engineering, and applied mathematics.
